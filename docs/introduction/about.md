# About

RiverTex is an open-source library for modeling and training different incremental word vector architectures proposed by the state-of-the-art.

It seeks to standardize many existing incremental word vector algorithms into a unified framework to provide a standardized
interface and facilitate the development of new methods.

RiverTex provides two training paradigms:

* `learn_one`, which trains one instance at a time;

* and `learn_many`, which trains a mini-batch of instances at a time.

This allows for more efficient training of text representation models with text data streams.

RiverText also provides an interface similar to the [`river`](https://riverml.xyz/0.14.0/) package, making it easy for developers to use the library to quickly and easily train text representation models.
